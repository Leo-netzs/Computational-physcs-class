# Project description

This repository is a space dedicated to the systematic study of Computational Physics, bringing together codes, simulations, visualizations and notes that seek to translate physical phenomena into algorithms and computational structures. The purpose of this project is to serve as a virtual laboratory where physical ideas and theories come to life through scientific programming â€” transforming differential equations, quantum problems and laws of thermodynamics into interactive numerical experiments. We also aims to create a basic neural network as a final project of the course using the tools described below.

This project is heavily based on Python, with the use of scientific libraries:

* NumPy: for vector and matrix operations

* Matplotlib and Plotly: for static and interactive visualizations

* Jupyter Notebook: for organizing and documenting studies
